Development of Human Language Technology Tools for Shona

This is a personal legacy project that I am doing on the side.

Shona is the first language of the majority of Zimbabweans. Depending on which dialects you include, it has between 8.6 and 15 million native speakers. It's grammar has been studied and documented for close to a hundred years, yet in this world of technological advances, it remains rooted in the pre-computing age. There are very few Human Language technology resources available for it. 

My goal is to start with the development of a Spell Checker for the language and then to move to a Grammar checker in the long term. I am definitely going to need help along the way, however for now, I am starting this journey mostly alone. I will be leaning heavily on the work of linguists who have done a lot of work documenting the structure of the language. Any contribution that I am likely to make will be mostly on the development of computational methods to work with the language, even though I will also be tapping onto work that has been done on similar languages here in South Africa.
